 <font face="Arial" font size="5" font color="151E3D"><b>1. Protect yourself from bloodborne pathogens</b></font> 
 <font face="Arial" font size="4" font color="4A4A4A">Bloodborne pathogens can threaten your health and wellbeing by causing sickness and disease. If you have a first aid kit, sanitize your hands and put on sterile gloves. If sterile gloves and sanitizer are not available, protect your hands with extra gauze or cotton. Avoid direct contact with the other person's blood. If you do end up making contact, make sure to clean yourself off as soon as possible. Eliminate any remaining sources of contamination.

<font face="Arial" font size="5" font color="151E3D"><b>2. Stop the bleeding first.</b></font> 
 <font face="Arial" font size="4" font color="4A4A4A">After you have established that the victim is breathing and has a pulse, your next priority should be to control any bleeding. Control of bleeding is one of the most important things you can do to save a trauma victim. Use direct pressure on a wound before trying any other method of managing to bleed. Read the linked article for more detailed steps you can take.

 <font face="Arial" font size="5" font color="151E3D"><b>3.Treat shock next.</b></font> 
 <font face="Arial" font size="4" font color="4A4A4A">Shock, often caused by a loss of blood flow to the body, frequently follows physical and occasionally psychological trauma. A person in shock will frequently have cool, clammy skin, be agitated or have an altered mental status, and have pale color to the skin around the face and lips. Untreated, shock can be fatal. Anyone who has suffered a severe injury or life-threatening situation is at risk for shock.</font>

<font face="Arial" font size="5" font color="151E3D"><b>4. Provide first aid for a broken bone</b></font> 
 <font face="Arial" font size="4" font color="4A4A4A">A broken bone, however common, can be treated with the following steps:</font> 
        <br>
        <br>
<font face="Arial" font size="4" font color="4A4A4A"> <li>Immobilize the area. Make sure that the broken bone doesn't have to move or support any other body parts.
    <font face="Arial" font size="4" font color="4A4A4A"> <li>Numb the pain. Often, this can be done with an ice pack covered by a towel.
       <font face="Arial" font size="4" font color="4A4A4A">  <li> Make a splint. A bundle of newspapers and sturdy tape will do just the trick. A broken finger, for example, can also use another finger as a stabilizing splint.
      <font face="Arial" font size="4" font color="4A4A4A">  <li>Make a sling, if necessary. Tie a shirt or a pillowcase around a broken arm and then around the shoulder.

The Heimlich maneuver is performed by straddling the victim from behind and bear-hugging them with your hands interlocked above their belly button but beneath their breastbone. Thrust upward to expel air from the lungs and repeat until you are successful in clearing the object from the windpipe.
